Valle (\u201dTorch\u201d), Commander, 101st Air and Space Operations Group, and Director of the Joint Air Component Coordination Element, 1st Air Force, responsible for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, has the following comment:\n\n\u2026They have the generators, water, food, medicine, and fuel on the ground, yet the supplies are not moving across the island as quickly as they\u2019re needed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government\u201d..
