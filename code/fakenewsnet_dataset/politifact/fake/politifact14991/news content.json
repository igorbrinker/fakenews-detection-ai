Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/Drone-Video-of-Migrant-Apprehension-in-Laredo-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/Biden-Corvette-1-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/GettyImages-1236627157-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/darrell-brooks-jr-mugshot-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/05/GettyImages-458421344-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/01/Biden-in-Georgia-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/AP21113697202157-e1637782496892-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/GettyImages-1197860517-e1637778046480-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/GettyImages-1208556692-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/02/nursing-home-coronavirus-patient-ambulance-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/brian-kemp-ap-wire-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/51645484340_4257e0c3cb_o-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/Ahmaud-Arbery-Getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/GettyImages-1276421423-e1637779768514-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/bordr-crossing-trucks-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hunter-joe-biden-sunglasses-AP-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/GettyImages-1236771742-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/Del-Rio-Large-Group-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/pexels-cottonbro-4694569-inset-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/wi/ap/23/ahmaud-arbery-georgia-defendant-travis-mcmichael-trial-william-roddie-bryan-gregory-mcmicha-e1637781789124-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/Rittenhouse-Selects-Jurors-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "Rep.
