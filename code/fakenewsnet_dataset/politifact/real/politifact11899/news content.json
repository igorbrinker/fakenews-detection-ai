First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K36P4YPZWY57LO6SIQAFZ2KDNM.jpg&w=1440", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/elections/2020/icons/election-icon-40-section-front.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K36P4YPZWY57LO6SIQAFZ2KDNM.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/11/transcript-the-democratic-debate-in-milwaukee-annotated/", "title": "Transcript: The Democratic debate in Milwaukee, annotated", "meta_data": {"description": "It's the second one-on-one debate between Sanders and Clinton.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/11/transcript-the-democratic-debate-in-milwaukee-annotated/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K36P4YPZWY57LO6SIQAFZ2KDNM.jpg&w=1440", "title": "Transcript: The Democratic debate in Milwaukee, annotated", "description": "It's the second one-on-one debate between Sanders and Clinton."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Transcript: The Democratic debate in Milwaukee, annotated", "description": "It's the second one-on-one debate between Sanders and Clinton."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-29T10:26:49.200Z", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-12T01:34:15.000Z", "modified_time": "2019-04-29T10:26:49.200Z", "section": "The Fix", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width", "next-head-count": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1455159600.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
