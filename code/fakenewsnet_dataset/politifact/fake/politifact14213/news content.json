The event, according to NASA, hasn\u2019t occurred in over 1 Million years. Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2017 at 3am, and will end on Monday, November 30, 2017 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the \u2018November Black Out\u2019 event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter.\n\n[ooyala player_id=\u201d5df2ff5a35d24237905833bd032cd5d8\u2033

10\n\nThe internet hoax isn\u2019t news, with many liars claiming darkness will descend in some New World Order extra-terrestrial scam.\n\nNASA has denied it will happen time and time again, stating in over one million years, an event like this has never occurred.\n\nThe overactive imaginations of conspiracy theorists must be commended, but perhaps next time, put it into a work of science fiction rather than try and pass it off as a NASA-confirmed fact.\n\nCraig Hamilton-Parker / Youtube\n\nAdvert 10\n\nMeanwhile, on the Internet, other theorists are gearing up for their psychic predictions for 2018, like Craig Hamilton-Parker, the self-proclaimed modern day Nostradamus.\n\nA self-proclaimed prophet, who wants to seemingly shatter your dreams, hopes and aspirations for next year with his special potion of unproven alarm and fear-mongering mysticism.\n\nHamilton-Parker, who shares all his best work on YouTube and psychics.com from his home in Southampton, foresees a US attack on North Korea, a chemical attack on a European city and an attempt to impeach Trump.\n\nGetty\n\nHe doesn\u2019t reveal his sources, but it seems he\u2019s really keeping up with current affairs in his mission to pull predictions out of his backside.\n\nFor 2018 he\u2019s bookmarked in his calendar the following world crises: US forces striking North Korea by blowing up a key trade route, Kim Jong-un being overthrown by his own people, a failed attempt to impeach Donald Trump and the sinking of a US warship.\n\nGetty\n\nThe good news is there\u2019s absolutely no proof this guy has any more insight into what\u2019s going to happen to the global political and social climate in 2018, than he does into what I\u2019m going to have for my dinner.", "images":
