I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated. So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OEAM3JW2IZ2PJIBX4CIKAXPEQ.jpg&w=1440", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/elections/2020/icons/election-icon-40-section-front.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OEAM3JW2IZ2PJIBX4CIKAXPEQ.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/10/the-cnn-miami-republican-debate-transcript-annotated/", "title": "The CNN Miami Republican debate transcript, annotated", "meta_data": {"description": "Washington Post reporters add insight and analysis to the transcript from Thursday's GOP debate at the University of Miami.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/10/the-cnn-miami-republican-debate-transcript-annotated/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OEAM3JW2IZ2PJIBX4CIKAXPEQ.jpg&w=1440", "title": "The CNN Miami Republican debate transcript, annotated", "description": "Washington Post reporters add insight and analysis to the transcript from Thursday's GOP debate at the University of Miami."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The CNN Miami Republican debate transcript, annotated", "description": "Washington Post reporters add insight and analysis to the transcript from Thursday's GOP debate at the University of Miami."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-29T11:10:27.791Z", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-11T04:36:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2019-04-29T11:10:27.791Z", "section": "The Fix", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width", "next-head-count": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1457578800.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
